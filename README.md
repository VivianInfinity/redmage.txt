but at least i got this screenshot, which, like, nice

## what even is this class
redmage is, at its core, an assasin with high team utility. your job on a team is to secure picks for your team by biding your time, watching cooldowns, and diving deep to punish people who have burned their guard to ensure that your team has the numbers advantage. like all assasins in team based games, that means resisting the urge to go unga bunga and dive in as hard as humanly possible; your engages should be deliberate, and you should think about what can stop your engage and get you killed before you press the go button. 

that means you play selfish. as a redmage, there are few times where you should be dying for your team. frankly, you're not very good at getting value for your life, at least compared to actual supports like paladin. 

redmage also centers around heavy burst/downtime phases, with burst being focused on melee combo uptime and downtime being focused on filler verstone->veraero or verfire->verthunder time. you are only really a real job during your melee phases and provide mediocre poke during dualcast phases, much like pve redmage. but hey, at least in pve dragoon is more useful because their rotation is harder ~~cope and seethe cope and seethe~~

finally, redmage is flexible and that makes it hard ~~name of my sex tape~~. you usually have a lot of options as to how you want to approach each situation, and i can't give you the solutions to all of them. the goal here is to give you heuristics; you're gonna have to use your brain to know when to apply them. 

## reading your buttons
i will now be reading your buttons. feel free to skip this section if you can read, the tooltips are correct (i think) and i'm not gonna go over that much that isn't obvious in here. i'm also not putting numbers on some of this in the futile attempt to make this guide salient for longer.

**Black Shift/White Shift:** just about everything in redmage revolves around your stance. most of your abilities have additional effects based on whether you are in black or white shift. this is the core of what redmage is. the ability itself does nothing on its own beyond taking a ogcd weave slot, and you start in white shift. 

**Melee Combo (Enchanted Riposte -> Enchanted Zwerchhau -> Enchanted Redoublement):** behold, braindead pve combo. in black shift, you do a pretty substantial amount of damage, and in white shift, you give yourself mediocre shields. this puts you in melee range, so this is also when you are most vulnerable. the blackshift damage over time calculations will snapshot on application; that means it will tick full strength through guard if it was applied before the guard went up and tick at shit strength if it was applied on a guard. this alone makes attacking a guard almost worthless and makes redmage almost uniquely good at diving low-health enemies.

**Verflare/Verholy:** the finisher to your melee combo, which replaces the enchanted riposte button blah blah do you really need this section. big damage in blackshift, damage + teammate healing in the AOE for whiteshift, plus a guaranteed personal heal. 

**Magick Barrier/Frazzle:** in white shift, you and your allies gain 10% damage reduction and 20% healing potency up. in blackshift, enemies take 10% bonus damage and reduce healing potency by 20%. you generally want to be frazzling people as much as possible and use magick barrier on opener or if you'd hit a substantial number of people with it. which to use when is situational.

**Verstone/Veraero/Verfire/Verthunder:** trash filler. first cast activates duocast, which allows your next cast to be instant. in practice, this means that over 2.4 seconds, you can do 10k in a burst if you pay the tax of standing still, not breaking line of sight, not doing anything for the next 2.4, and not using your elixer. unlike pve, every single one of these is 5k; you get no real benefit from duocasting, and there's no difference in stances. 

**Resolution:** a strong contender for the most powerful non-limit break ability in the game. notable damage in a line. in whiteshift, this also silences for 2 seconds, while in blackshift, this binds for 3 seconds. which version is more powerful is very situational, but the aoe CC is really good either way

**Corps-a-corps:** 4k dash in that makes your target take 10% bonus damage from you while also making you take 10% less damage from them. the single best 1v1 tool in the game that isn't a limit break, and a high amount of damage on an oGCD alone. there are (rare) situations where you just dash in, backflip out, dash in, backflip out for 16k damage if you're really dry on other resources to secure a kill. 2 charges, and absolutely core to keep track of.

**Displacement:** 4k potency backflip for 15 yalms that also increases your next _spellcast_ damage by 20%. the only spells in your kit are verflare/verholy and the 5k filler; this applies to nothing else. 2 charges, and also absolutely core to keep track of.

**Limit Break - Southern Cross:** 2 lines form an X at your target with the arms of the X always postioned at 45 degrees (i.e. you will never be hit by this unless you're in the center). each line does 6k damage to enemies and 6k healing to allies. in white shift, the healing is doubled; in black shift, the damage is doubled. anyone in the center is hit twice, meaning your _target_ is _guaranteed_ to be hit twice. in black shift, this is 24k burst with 12k healing. 

## tl;dr gameplay rules of thumb
![me in most games](/img/Pasted image 20220914132626.png)
_pictured: me in most games_

your priorities as a redmage are, in order (roughly): 

1. don't die.

this is the single most important thing as a redmage. this is arguably important on everyone, but this is especially true on redmage. arguably, there is no job in the game on the enemy team that is worth a 1 for 1 trade, including the enemy redmage. 

don't die. 

seriously, don't die. 

just about everything about playing redmage in practice is a balancing act of taking as much risk as possible without dying. that means white shifting to give yourself a shield if you're concerned you're not going to have enough time to recoup, that means magick barriering defensively and only on yourself if you need to, that means backflipping mid melee combo and wasting the cooldown if you need to. this means, first and foremost, *not taking stupid engages.* don't dash in wtihout a plan. never dash in without a plan for how you're going to get out, be that purify, guard, a backflip, recoup spam, or by killing everyone alive.

2. track cooldowns. 

eat the bitch that has their guard down. always watch guards. you're incredible against a target without guard due to your high damage output, frazzle, and ability to bind and lock them down for a moment. you're shit if you get crowd controlled and if your dive would do no damage. 

3. secure kills. 

people do 0 dps when dead, and death is the best CC. if swapping targets mid melee secures a kill on someone, do it. focus who your team is focusing, and don't worry about wasted dot ticks.

4. get maximum value from your spells by applying the best form for the situation. 

this one's actually kinda difficult, and much of this guide is going to be about when to white shift or black shift certain spells. 

5. keep momentum. 

momentum, in general, is best thought about on redmage as "how many resources do I have over the opponent to keep pressure going." things like "how many recoups do i have remaininng on an engage, and will that health allow me to put more pressure on the enemy front or back line to make them burn resources faster than we do." things like "can my team afford to wait for me to have the purify up in 5 seconds so my engage can put out more damage pressure without having to disengage." things like "can i pre-guard to waste their resources." things like "do i get to potion here to get mana while they're unable to recover resources." 

## tl;dr combos
### the nut combo
whiteshift resolution -> black shift, corps-a-corps -> 1 -> frazzle -> 2 -> recoup, probably -> 3 -> recoup, displacement -> verflare

8k + 4k + 1.1x(6k + 6k + 1.1x(7k+6k + 8k+6k + 4k + 1.2x12k)) = ***80,134 damage.*** 

every 20 seconds. 

obviously, this is overkill, and it happens over 10ish seconds, meaning it's pretty easy to just Hit Recouperate and shrug off the damage if you're not being pressured. situations where you will get this off fully get increasingly uncommon the higher your rank. if you started blackshift resolution, you frazzle sooner and your damage goes to 81,454.

### finishing burst aoe
verflare -> southern cross = 36k damage, or a marksman's spite on everyone in a 5 yalm radius. remember this breakpoint; this is a little over half health for most of the cast. people often start to expect this, so be wary about if the target has guard, since unlike spite, you can guard a lot of this damage on reaction if you're quick. it might be better to do it on someone you're not focusing for the mixup.



aight, time to get specific about shit

## general gamesense advice
### the opener
probably the most important single engage of a game and probably the most difficult one to execute correctly. this phase, when everyone is looking at each other across both sides of a locked crystal like idiots, determines who has momentum at the beginning of the game, and a lead in kills here will usually result in faster limit break generation (on account of being alive) and thus give the team that wins the opener an advantage for the next fight.

as a team, your goal is to either explode one person to make it a 4v5 as fast as possible or to defend against the initial aggression and punish the people who are diving by... killing someone and making it a 4v5 as fast as possible. we'll talk about these two situations separately, with the understanding that these are not the only two situations in the opener. 

#### aggressive open (unga bunga)
guess who has a puny health pool and is easily murdered by 5 people who just saw you CaC into the middle of their team after that Sick As Fuck resolution 

while there are exceptions, in general, redmage does not want to be the first person on the team getting deep into the enemy frontline. generally, that's the job of whoever is the tank on your team; paladin, dark knight, reaper, gunbreaker, warrior, monk, samurai, all of these classes have much, MUCH stronger defensive options and substantially higher health pools; if they dive in, they might even get to guard before they die. 

while they're soaking a ton of damage and eating some of the bigger cooldowns from the enemy team like the good little meatsack they are, your job became a lot clearer; you try to create a numbers advantage be that by saving your tank's life or by killing a backliner or two, and that should be a lot easier now that the enemy team is all stacked onto that meatsack's juicy body, conveniently grouped for your silencing resolution. a preloaded magick barrier, silence, and dashing in for a bit of provoking action helps you make sure that their resources get less value than yours.

did you mark the target you're dashing into? no? are you dashing into the target someone else marked? no? you fucked up about 5 seconds ago, because you're not a healer, and your cute little magick barrier and silence crowd control are not going to save your tank forever if you can't secure a kill. this is where you hope you have human beings on your team and you hope that you are enough of a human being to kill the person you've (hopefully) noticed has burned guard or has already recouped a bunch. if someone has already used guard, this phase gets a lot easier; mark them, and kill them. in black shift, the one that does damage. and make sure you don't die. 

if nobody has used guard, this gets a bit more complicated, and it's somewhat likely that nobody has used guard if your team is the one initiating the fight with their faces. remember that your top priority is to survive, and if that means you can't push more damage, that's fine. this opener is where like... 80% of my time as white shift gets spent; by dashing in with CaC in white shift, you can "soft open," putting pressure onto the enemy while generating health for yourself to live long enough (and hopefully save enough mana) that your next engage in 20 seconds can be in full black shift with the intent to kill. in this situation, your goal often is just to get as many people to guard as possible; hit a person, see them guard, swap targets, see them guard, get out, take note of who just guarded, and remember their faces as the people you're murdering in 20 seconds. 

#### defensive open (for when they unga bunga)
guess who has a puny health pool and is easily murdered by 4 people and a warrior main who just saw you commit the crime of trying to cast veraero for some early game poke

similar to in aggressive opens, redmage does not want to be dove on. while redmage is largely a melee class, it doesn't have to start in melee range; it's best to play about 10-15 yalms away from your frontline or behind walls so you're able respond to engages while also save yourself from being the person being engaged on. 

if you were the person being engaged upon, reflect on your choices and why you stood where you stood in the opener, in range of the enemy team, then pray they fuck up more than you did and you get a chance to purify (probably) and guard.

besides that, the mechanics play largely the same as the aggressive opener; get that big value silence cleave, then go to town on black shift. the difference is that since they're being aggressive, it's usually pretty brainless for your team to hit the guy that just 1v5ed, so they're much, much more likely to have to pop guard first. watch guards, smack them when they're down. 

#### _really_ defensive open (for when you can feel the 1 marker on your head)
so you fucked up and now there are 5 people on your ass. what do you do?

step 1: don't immediately die before you get a chance to respond. this is ultimately just either predicting that they will be diving on your ass and pre-guarding or hoping that they aren't coordinated enough for you to not be able to purify -> guard. usually, if you're here, your options were about 5 seconds ago. 

step 2: wait for major cooldowns. due to how the netcode works and how human brains work, it'll usually take a little bit for players to notice that you're in guard, and if they're not specifically anticipating you to immediately guard, this often buys you a little bit of breathing room. the 3 to 5 seconds you spend in guard looking awkwardly at them is often enough for your team to do something about your helplessness or their team to decide that they're better off hitting someone else or disengaging. this, also, is largely out of your control. 

step 3: backflip, probably. this creates space and forces them to dive deeper, which can give your team more chances to punish them for a possible overextension. you do not always take this option, but it's common. 

step 4: white shift everything. at this point, every little bit of health is probably going to matter, so burn that shit on shields, recoups, and verholy. 

step 5: you're probably dead, but if you're not, slink off elsewhere and drink your potion. 

again, if you are in this position, it is extremely likely you fucked up about 5 seconds ago. if you're following these heuristics, it is a sign that either you made a mistake somewhere or the enemy team is massively overcomitting to a kill they cannot secure. think on your sins, basically

## specific mechanics and ways to think about your skills
holy shit this guide is fucking exhausting to write, why am i doing this

### resolution/melee alignment and potioning
they're both on a 20 second cooldown, which should be a big screaming arrow saying "pair us" in your mind, and you should. the value of resolution -> melee combo isn't just that the crowd control makes your dive safer (was that not enough of a reason, this is a very, very good reason), but that resolution applies its damage late in the GCD. that means that if you dash in on the second half of the GCD window and immediately start swinging, your resolution damage, CaC damage, and enchanted riposte damage all come out basically within the same second. this can immediately put a squishy into a situation where they're too low to be able to spend time doing anything other than recouperating (a situation I call the **recouperate loop**), or they'll die to black shift damage. as of writing, that's 21k burst nearly instantly with the threat of at least 3k more in bleed, plus more melee swings to come. 

you are SUBSTANTIALLY weaker when you do not pair these together. you don't always have to; don't int to keep it aligned, but keep it in mind for when you can control the engages.

funny thing, though, is that your burst combo only takes about 10 seconds from resolution to verflare. that leaves you exactly 2 cycles of verstone -> veraero before your combo comes up again, or 20k damage over 10 seconds if the stars align and you are blessed by the gods. compared to the 80kish damage from the other 10 seconds, this is basically negligible compared to the risk you take from standing still. 

this, conveniently, makes it a great time to duck around a corner and take 5 seconds to drink a potion, refilling the mana you probably spent on your last engage. this alone can make redmage one of the highest uptime jobs in the game, since the time you spend potioning is often not that important anyways. 

![potion0](/img/Pasted image 20220914191418.png)
and you should probably do this.

![potion1](/img/Pasted image 20220914191440.png)
seriously, potion more than you probably think you should when you're just starting out (or if you have that pve parsing mindset). your health, much more than other classes, is a resource you do not have nearly enough of, and you will need to hit recoup more often than tankier classes and will often have to waste full recoup value just to stay out of burst range. 

you are probably not potioning enough.

![potion2](/img/Pasted image 20220914191540.png)
_you are probably not potioning enough._

### resolution (or why i put off writing this guide)
![](/img/Pasted image 20220914130914.png)
_pictured: resolution binding two dummies and showing that the range is a bit wider than the graphic implies_

hey remember like three thousand years ago when i said that resolution may be the most impactful skill in the game, and that you should always pair it with your melee combo

well you shouldn't _always_ always pair it with your melee combo. and that makes it weirdly difficult to use.

"oh boo hoo redmage main complaining about resolution as though silence isn't broken as shit" yes, it's strong, it's time to learn how to make it stronger

#### silence
the whiteshift version of resolution which the community (probably rightfully) agrees is the most useful version of the skill. as an offensive tool, you can force the enemy to burn an oGCD slot purifying and not allow them to guard or recouperate. this opens a window of opportunity to either outright kill them or force them to spam recouperate to not immediately die to the rapidly increasing amount of damage you're stacking up with blackshift melee combo and other teammates are stacking with whatever buttons they have. i call this the **recouperate loop** and it's often a death sentence if you're stuck in it, since depending on the game state, someone stuck in it might be forced to keep hitting recouperate even if they have guard available just to stay alive.

whiteshift resolution gets more powerful the more people you hit (duh), as it forces more people to use purify (duh), allowing you to trade your one skill for massive amounts of future pressure. if you're going to white shift resolution, try to get as many people as you can with it. 

that said, since people in whiteshift can still keep moving, it becomes a lot weaker when the people you're hitting with it are 1, running towards your face (but not already on you), or 2, running away from you (but not already underneath you). this leads to the most useful heuristic for when to whiteshift resolution; consider where the enemy clump you're hitting is, and consider if you want them to stay there. if not, hit silence. in fact, silence is powerful enough that it should probably be your default.

#### bind
in my mind, the blackshift version of resolution is massively underrated. it is an incredible tool to keep someone from touching the point, to keep specific people from rejoining the fight, to chase someone down, to make a dive safer by letting you use natural cover more effectively, to set up an easier backflip as an escape, and other uses. 

keeping people from touching the point, keeping people from rejoining the fight, and setting up backflips are pretty obvious, so i'm not gonna go into more detail about them. the wall thing is more complicated, but you get a feel for it over time and it's kinda hard to give specifics that aren't related to the map (tl;dr this is especially good on volcano).

one caveat: if they're already on top of you, binding is probably a lot less valuable than silencing. either way, both resolutions help you set up a backflip to get out easier.

##### as a chase tool
as a chase tool, blackshift resolution's value is somewhat subtle; obviously, your target stays in a compromised position, but they also are forced to hit purify before sprinting to try to get away. combined with your gapclose, this often means that you have more time to keep up with your opponent, potentially allowing you to either save your second stack of gapclose or use it later in the melee combo to ensure that they stay in range. this alone can be the difference between securing a kill or not. on top of that, depending on where you hit the bind, blackshift resolution allows you to stay on top of your target and keep that location closer to your team and further from deep inside the enemy zone of control; this can make your dive safer by keeping you from having to go out of position to maintain uptime. 

bind can be especially useful to keep the target you're trying to kill from getting to a potion on the ground; by binding and dashing, you can often steal the potion from them. 

##### as a setup
you know how salted earth pulls everyone into a nice and tidy clump to be limit broken by everyone with a cleave? resolution can be the poor man's version of that, depending on if the enemy fucks up positioning. this is a great way to ensure your southern cross gets big value, and would you look at that, you're already in blackshift to do it. near unreactable. 

##### as a saved ogcd
this is, to me, the most underrated part of bind resolution. 

you know how if you start silence, you need to use an ogcd to swap to black shift so your melee combo actually does damage? well, look at that, now you don't have to do that, meaning you can frazzle earlier in your melee combo. and would you look at that, you just opened yourself another ogcd window to recouperate and keep your squishy ass alive when you're diving. 

this is 15k health you gain access to. 

_this is 15k health you gain access to earlier in your melee combo._

_this is 15k health you gain access to earlier in your melee combo that allows you to keep unga bungaing and not lose uptime._

there are people who main redmage that argue that this isn't enough of a reason to choose bind over silence. they're probably right. but it's certainly not as bad an option as people seem to think, and it means that you should be actively considering the pros and cons of each version of resolution, especially if you're getting hard focused. a lot of the complexity in redmage comes from deciding which version is more valuable based on the current situation, and more actively thinking about how to use resolution is probably the second biggest thing you can do to improve your gameplay besides not inting your brains out to keep 100% uptime.

##### some other notes
as with all abilities that cleave, you generally want to hit as many people as you can with it, but the pressure to do this with bind is often a lot lower than the pressure to do this with silence. again, consider whether you want the enemy clump you're hitting to stay where they are; if their current position and not moving from it isn't specifically valuable or if they're already where they want to be, you are possibly wasting a resolution that might be better used with silence. 

the reason for this is pretty obvious; a bound target can still hit all of their buttons besides movement; this means that they can immediately guard and recoup to shrug off damage that might be coming in and can still hit the person in front of them (usually), which means the pressure to hit purify is substantially lower, which means they are much less likely to be put into a recouperate loop by virtue of having more resources to respond with. if they don't recouperate, and they didn't need to move, you might as well have not crowd controlled them. 

### magick barrier/frazzle
![magickbarrier](/img/Pasted image 20220914131404.png)
_pictured: the range on magick barrier/frazzle and the clear circle that shows you that range in game_

fuck me this guide is long

the heuristic for barrier/frazzle one is a lot easier than for resolution; if you're about to fight, figure out how you hit the most people possible. let's talk about the nuances. 

#### magick barrier
it's healing up and damage mitigation, with the healing amplification often being substantially more important. that can often be a difference between life or death, and the 10% damage reduction is incredibly strong in solo queue where 1gcd burst is pretty uncommon. using this during the opener often allows your team to play more aggressively since you're pretty much guaranteed to hit at least your frontline. it also helps for when you know they're going to play aggressively.

#### frazzle
the bane of dark knights and the extra padding you need to ensure that your pretty long burst window will actually stack up. the healing down is probably more important, as it turns recouperate into a substantially less useful skill. use this on dives, as its one of your best tools to secure kills. 

generally, my rule of thumb is that 3 frazzles > 4 magick barriers since damage in this game is incredibly high, but it really depends on if you think you can get a kill with the frazzle. i don't have good heuristics for you here

### southern cross
this is the capstone ability to cement redmage as the "i have options" class. luckily for you, southern cross is only especially useful in blackshift. there are use cases for white shift that i'm gonna cover, but the use cases for black shift are a lot more common. 

unluckily for you, the use cases for blackshift southern cross are fucking infinite and it is really easy to get no value with it. if you're not deliberate with this, you might as well not have a limit break; it's pretty meh on its own

![limit break](/img/Pasted image 20220914130251.png)
_pictured: me blinding myself with limit break, just like in pve_

the way southern cross works in code is that you will create 2 lines at your target in the shape of an X with the arms of the cross pointed at 45 degree angles from the line between you and your target. each line does 6k damage and 6k healing, with damage doubled in blackshift and healing doubled in white. doubling twice means the center gets hit with 12k/24k healing/damage, depending on the version you choose, but since the ult itself is two separate AoEs and since damage applies sort of in a queue, the burst potential of blackshift is slightly (ish) delayed. although unlikely, this makes it possible to get a recoup between the two impacts and it makes it possible for a guard to only mitigate one of the lines for game's haunted reasons. 

in practice, what this means is that while it does 24k damage, it only _sorta_ does 24k burst, so if you're thinking about using it to kill someone and they're expecting it, simply seeing their health total go below 24k isn't always enough to ensure you'll get the kill. 

the shape of the cross and the fact that the lines of the X are at 45 degree angles from the line you draw between you and your target means that, for the most part, you will never actually get hit by your own southern cross unless you're in the center 5x5 yalm square. this alone makes a macro to launch southern cross on yourself incredibly valuable, and it's the only macro for redmage that i consider mandatory (or even useful). this also affects how you should use southern cross in certain situations. 

additionally, the angle of the cross will always be an X on your screen, so if you, for example, want to try to aim the arms down the corridors of volcano, stand at a 45 degree angle facing the corner. spin-flicking, unfortunately, doesn't do anything (i don't think) except change the animation on your client; if they were gonna get hit on button input, it doesn't matter where they are when the animation goes off. 

finally, southern cross's damage and healing are both affected by your frazzle/magick barrier and monomancy. this makes the optimal use for damage one where you dash in, frazzle, and southern cross. unfortunately, this is extremely telegraphed and pretty easy to guard, and it makes it way harder to actually get multiple targets with it since people are likely to scatter, so you'll have to judge how much that extra padding is needed and whether its worth putting yourself at risk to do it. 

southern cross's damage also comes out near instantly and only has a cooldown of about 2ish ogcd windows, which means you can basically weave it anywhere for minimal cost. this makes it an INCREDIBLE mixup tool; put it between your melee combo swings for the surprise factor, use it immediately after your duocast combo to get that extra bit of reach, straight up just toss it out reactively if you see dancer or dark knight's limit break, follow up dragoon's skyshatter with the extra bit of padding to wipe a team, so on. the speed is the best part about this limit break and that speed buys flexibility. 

oh southern cross, how do i love you, let me count (some of) the ways

#### as single target execution
this is probably the first way people start using southern cross. since southern cross comes out nearly instantly while verflare comes out so late in the gcd window, you can use the delayed timing of verflare to surprise someone with 36k burst. this is preeeeettyy gooooood, for sure, and if you can get a kill with it like this, you should consider it; you basically built a crap marksman's spite. that said, people are wise to this shit now, so a lot of people have gotten used to preguarding verflare, making your ability to actually do this combo dependent on what rank you're in. 

as time goes on, i find this to be less and less valuable a use of southern cross since you can use it...

#### for big fucking value (aka as offbrand dragoon)
is everyone fighting on the point in the same 5 yalms, duking it out to try to break the checkpoint? have both teams taken a bit of damage? throw that shit out there. hell, you might not even have to get a kill, depending on the situation. 

this is the most common use of redmage limit break at high tier; checkpoints and corners are common enough that its often unavoidable for teams to not be at least a little clumped, usually on top of one of your teammates. by hitting limit break, you create a 36k health swing between your team and the enemy; even more if you hit the verflare beforehand. this effectively putting them 3ish recouperates behind. they die faster, they run out of juice faster, your team lives, everybody is happy. 

until you realized that you basically only got to pull this off because everyone is grouped in the same 5 yalms. 

this is the major quirk about using redmage limit break like this; unlike dragoon's skyshatter, redmage's actually effective radius is incredibly small and it is reasonably difficult to get to a situation where that full value health swing takes effect. in my mind, the tempo is substantially less valuable than securing a kill at fewer than 3 enemies and 2 allies hit, arguably 4. that's kind of a big ask, so these limit breaks often only come out when you're sure you can finish a target with melee combo right after or can get a kill with the ult alone. in my mind, if you can hit 2 enemies and pretty reasonably kill someone after, you're good. 

if you can't, you better be hitting a lot of people. luckily, you're people. and you know who can benefit from 12k healing?

you. when you use it...

#### as a suicide bomber
i call this the suicide bomber strat and i'm definitely going to get flamed when low tier redmages rainbowing for the first time get themselves killed trying it. it is often really likely to get you not just killed, but to waste your limit break. that said, it's a very powerful engage option if and only if you're sure your team can keep you alive or can make use of the pressure you bought with your corpse. 

by dashing in and limit breaking, you are usually painting a massive target on your head that says "i am delivering myself as food." competent enemies will often use this time to hit you with some form of crowd control and start bursting you. this maximizes the value you get from suicide bombing, as after you purify the CC that probably hit you by now, you can immediately hit limit break on yourself and guard to heal yourself for the damage they took off you. hopefully, this makes it so they wasted not just powerful crowd control abilities, but also damage abilities inteded to get you to chew through mana. 

if they don't do this and instead immediately guard, this gives you time to set up monomancies on key targets and hit a frazzle to amp your limit break damage from 24k to 29k. this alone can often make a breakpoint for forcing someone to recoup loop, assuming you didn't already die from this stupid play.

i want to highlight this point; seriously consider if this is worth it and if you can be punished for doing this. it is really, really easy to just kill you, and this makes it pretty likely that you put your team into a 4v5 scenario. 

finally (for this guide), you can use it...

#### as another recouperate
this is arguably the worst use of limit break and is, coincidentally, the use of limit break that puts you in white shift. 24k healing (29k if amped with magick barrier) is kind of a difficult amount of healing to fully utilize on your team, since it is so, so unlikely that someone on your team is missing 30k hp and isn't immediately dead. maybe once in every 50 games, it'll happen, and you can save someone's life in white shift for just long enough for them to get their limit break off, but it's pretty rare. it is incredibly easy to overheal someone with it and reduce the value you get from this limit break, and for this reason alone, white shift southern cross is usually a terrible idea. 

sometimes, however, you're the one missing 30k health because you're getting dove by a monk and a ninja. you've tried backflipping out, you've collected every potion you can, you've tried binding and getting back to your team, you're out of mana, and you're 10 seconds from your next melee combo and the prayer that the shields will let you live. 

in this situation, it is very, very likely that your actual mistake was living; if two people are on your ass, it is likely because you fucked up your own engage or your entire team is already dead. by trying to live longer, it is pretty likely that you're just staggering yourself. it's also pretty likely that if you use limit break like this, your team might lose a fight from not having the reach to secure kills or tempo. seriously consider dying. 

but if the two people on your ass are legitimately goku fighting and your team is winning the 4v3 (i know, a big ask) and you need juuust a little longer to make sure you get value from wasting time.... there's the recoup. 

and there's another reason you want to have a self-targeted macro to southern cross yourself. 

for context, in about 70% of my self-targeted white shift limit breaks, i regret the decision.

honestly, after all the crap i wrote above, this section's not that complicated. it's a 5 yalm radius, so unless you're pressuring someone specifically or trying to kill (which, honestly, is most of the time), go for cleaves.

verflare's probably more valuable than verholy in like... 60-70% of cases, so if you're just starting, just go for cleaves. 

verholy is probably underrated as it is, at the very minimum, a 16k life swing rather than a 12k life swing, but it is usually more important to try to secure kills than it is to gain tempo at the stages of the game where you're typically given the choice of whicah finisher to use. honestly, how often are you not cleaving your verflare

in general, priority for usage is: 
1. whiteshift if it will save your life (if you're here, you probably already fucked up)
2. blackshift if it will secure a kill
3. whiteshift if it will save a teammate's life and they wouldn't die immediately after
4. whiteshift if it will hit more teammates than enemies
5. blackshift
